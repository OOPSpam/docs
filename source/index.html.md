It is usually used for:

1. Contact forms
2. Comment & Review systems
3. Live & Private chats
4. Email marketing
5. and any platform where message and content exchanged

Submit messages to the API and it will produce Spam ```Score``` with a detailed report. Using ```Score``` you can adjust the sensitivity level (also known as _spam threshold_) of spam filtering to fit your use case.

![OOPSpam API request and response example](https://www.oopspam.com/assets/TestGraphic.png)

You can test the API right on your browser with your data on [OOPSpam Dashboard](https://app.oopspam.com/#test-with-your-data) or [the RapidAPI marketplace](https://rapidapi.com/oopspam/api/oopspam-spam-filter).

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/9739f63cd7bc67da898f?action=collection%2Fimport)

The API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). All requests should be made over SSL. All request and response bodies, including errors, are encoded in JSON.

# 👩‍🏫 Developer Support

As Developers we understand that no API Reference can answer every question.

We have a Developer to Developer support system where if you are working with our API you can speak directly to a developer.

If you have a question about our API just start a conversation with us using the chat widget on this page or via <a href="mailto:contact@oopspam.com">contact@oopspam.com</a>.

# 🔑 Authentication

The OOPSpam API uses API keys to identify and authorize calls. You can register for a new API key in two ways:

1. **Recommended** [Directly on our dashboard](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Register)
2. [OOPSpam on RapidAPI marketplace](https://rapidapi.com/oopspam/api/oopspam-spam-filter/)

The account on RapidAPI and on our Dashboard are dissociated. Each of these registration methods has its own base URL and API-KEY. You must therefore adapt your scripts according to your subscription by adapting the URL and your API KEY.

OOPSpam API expects the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

- For OOPSpam Dashboard endpoint: ```X-Api-Key: API_KEY```
- For RapidAPI endpoint: ```X-Rapidapi-Key: API_KEY```


<aside>
<div  class="success">
👉 Replace <code>API_KEY</code> with your API key
</div>
</aside>

Check out [Using the API via Dashboard](#using-the-api-via-dashboard) and [Using the API via RapidAPI](#using-the-api-via-rapidapi) for additional information.

<aside>
<div class="warning">
🚧 <strong>Keep your API keys secret</strong>

<p>Do not share your API keys in publicly accessible areas or put them in version control or client-side code. It's a good practice to set secrets like the API key as environment variable and then read it in the code.</p>
</div>
</aside>

## Using the API via Dashboard

The base URL : `https://api.oopspam.com/v1`

If you decided to subscribe directly on our site, you have [OOPSpam Dashboard](https://app.oopspam.com/Identity/Account/Register) at your disposal.

It allows you to:

- To follow your consumption in real time
- Manage your subscription and change it if necessary
- Test the endpoint without writing a line of code.

<aside>
<div class="success">
👉 Make sure to include <code>X-Api-Key: API_KEY</code> in a request header and replace <code>API_KEY</code> with your API key.

## Using the API via RapidAPI

The base URL : `https://oopspam.p.rapidapi.com/v1`

<aside>
<div class="notice">
ℹ️ <strong>What is RapidAPI?</strong>
<p> RapidAPI, the world's largest API Marketplace, is used by over one million developers to find, test, and connect to thousands of > APIs — all with a single account, API Key, and SDK. You can learn more about it <a href="https://docs.rapidapi.com/docs/what-is-rapidapi">here</a>. </p>
</div>
</aside>

If you decided to subscribe to the API via [RapidAPI marketplace](https://rapidapi.com/oopspam/api/oopspam-spam-filter/) then all information related to your subscription are available on the RapidAPI developer dashboard.

The RapidAPI developer dashboard is where you can see all of your apps, locate API keys, view analytics, and manage billing settings.

To access the dashboard, simply login to RapidAPI and select 'My Apps' in the top-right menu. Alternatively, you can head directly to [https://rapidapi.com/developer/dashboard](https://rapidapi.com/developer/dashboard).

In the main dashboard, you will see account-wide analytics and account information. To get more detailed information, you can select tabs on the left-hand side of the screen.

### App Specific Analytics

Using the RapidAPI dashboard, you can also view analytics specific to each app in your account. To do so, switch over to the 'Analytics' tab of your application in the dashboard.

On the top of the page, you'll be able to see:

- A chart with all the calls being made to the API
- Logs with all the request data

In each graph, you can view the following metrics:

- ```API Calls```: how many requests are being made
- ```Error rates```: how many requests are error some
- ```Latency```: how long (on average) requests take to execute

You can find your API KEY under 'Security' tab.

![RapidAPI Developer Dashboard](/images/screenshots/sc_rapidApi.png)

# 🚦 Rate Limiting

OOPSpam API uses sliding window algorithm for rate limiting. 


> Headers via OOPSpam endpoint

```sass
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 998
```

> Headers via RapidAPI endpoint

```sass
x-ratelimit-requests-limit: 40
x-ratelimit-requests-remaining: 1
```

Depending on your subscription, limits are placed on the number of API requests you may make using your API key per 30-days..
All responses from the API contain information about remaining and total rate limit. The special ```X-RateLimit-```
headers have the following meaning:

Header | Description
--------- | -----------
```X-RateLimit-Limit``` ```x-ratelimit-requests-limit``` |  The number of requests per month for the plan you are currently subscribed
```X-RateLimit-Remaining``` ```x-ratelimit-requests-remaining``` |  The number of requests remaining before you reach the limit of requests your application is allowed to make
```x-ratelimit-requests-reset``` |  Time at which the request counter is reset. Available only to RapidAPI endpoint

If you exceeds this threshold your application will be unable to make further requests until the rate limit resets.

<aside>
<div class="notice">
ℹ️ <strong>How Do I See My Current Usage?</strong>
<p>Besides the above headers, you can see your API usage via RapidAPI Developer dashboard and OOPSpam Dashboard according to your subscription.</p>

> The above command may return JSON structured like this:

```json
{
  "Score": 6,
  "Details": {
    "isIPBlocked": true,
    "isEmailBlocked": true,
    "isContentSpam": "spam",
    "langMatch": true,
    "countryMatch": false,
    "numberOfSpamWords": 1,
    "spamWords": [
      "dear"
    ],
    "isContentTooShort": false
  }
}
```

> Note that OOPSpam API tries to return the result as soon as one of the analyses detects spam. Hence some fields may not appear in the response body. Say ```senderIP``` is blocked then it will return following response without doing other analyses:

```json
{
  "Score": 6,
  "Details": {
    "isIPBlocked": true,
    "isContentTooShort": false
  }
}
```

The endpoint analyses given parameters and returns overall spam score (```Score```) including detailed detection results in structured JSON.

## Report

You can use this endpoint to report any false positives and false negatives to us. All the submissions will be available on [OOPSpam Dashboard](https://app.oopspam.com/) under the Reported page. The status of each report will be either <span style="color:green">Solved</span> or <span style="color:orange">Pending</span>. We then analyze them and improve detection for your use case. Every processed submission will be marked as <span style="color:green">Solved</span>.

### HTTP Request

> Example request and response body

```json
{
    "senderIP": "91.203.67.110",
    "email": "testing@example.com",
    "content": "Dear Agent, We are a manufacturing company which specializes in supplying Aluminum Rod with Zinc Alloy Rod to customers worldwide, based in Japan, Asia. We have been unable to follow up payments effectively for transactions with debtor customers in your country due to our distant locations, thus our reason for requesting for your services representation.",
    "checkForLength": true,
    "allowedLanguages" : ["en"],
    "allowedCountries" : ["it","us"],
    "shouldBeSpam": true
}
```

```json
{
  "message": "success"
}
```

`POST /spamdetection/report`

The request body is identical to [/spamdetection](#spam-detection) endpoint. The only difference is an extra boolean field `shouldBeSpam` which takes the value of `true` or `false`. This field tells us if a content is false negative or false positive.

<table class="table">
                  <thead>
                  <tr>
                      <th scope="col">Field</th>
                      <th scope="col">Definition</th>
                  </tr>
                  </thead>
                  <tbody>
                   <tr>
                        <td><code>shouldBeSpam</code></td>
                      <td><strong>boolean (required)</strong> A value represents whether the reported misdetection should be spam or ham. Pass <code>true</code> for spam, <code>false</code> for ham.</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                    </table>

| Good day, \r\n\r\nMy name is Eric and unlike a lot of emails you might get, I wanted to instead provide you with a word of encouragement – Congratulations\r\n\r\nWhat for?  \r\n\r\nPart of my job is to check out websites and the work you’ve done with pos-cash.de definitely stands out. \r\n\r\nIt’s clear you took building a website seriously and made a real investment of time and resources into making it top quality.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a catch… more accurately, a question…\r\n\r\nSo when someone like me happens to find your site – maybe at the top of the search results (nice job BTW) or just through a random link, how do you know? \r\n\r\n 	| 45.152.198.112, 196.16.74.95 	| testing@example.com, test@test.com 	|

# 💡 Tips

- Responded ```Score``` parameter value ranges from 0 to 6. A value 3 or higher can be considered spam.
- Make async HTTP request instead of sync as the system check ```senderIP``` against multiple IP denylists until it finds it.
